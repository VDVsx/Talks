# Grafana dashboard

Dashboard used in the demo.

Before importing make sure Loki and Prometheus are configured as datasources in Grafana and also Loki is added to a additional Prometheus datasource with the name `loki-prom`. This might change in the future once Grafana was full support for Loki counts and aggregations.
